Central Processing Unit (CPU) - 1GHz or faster
2 or more cores

Storage- 64 GB or more

RAM - 4 GB

GPU - DirectX12 compatiblility or later with WDDM 2.0 driver

Display - HD 720p display

Backup existing data
Locate application software and license keys
Locate third-party drivers
Create a system image
Verify software compatibility

INSTALLATION TYPE:

Will this be a clean installation?
Upgrade installation?
or
Repair installation? 

A clean installation is performed on an existing or new system. The clean installation is a fresh instance of the operating system with default settings and overwrite any existing data on the storage device. 
An upgrade is performed on an existing system that is running an earlier version of Windows. The installation upgrades Windows to a newer version while preserving the existing data, settings, and applications currently installed. 
A repair installation installs a new build over the current installation. The process repairs registry entries and working files without losing applications or user information.
